## 🎯 Problem Statement & User Insights

Hostel and mess complaints are often reported through informal channels such as messages, calls, verbal communication, or scattered forms. This can lead to:

- Complaints getting lost or overlooked
- Multiple students reporting the same issue separately
- Complaints reaching the wrong department
- No clear visibility into complaint status
- Delayed resolution
- No automatic escalation when important issues remain unresolved

### User Research

We conducted a preliminary survey with **22 students** to understand their hostel and mess complaint experiences and identify common pain points.

**Key findings:**

- *63.6%* reported facing mess food quality issues, while *54.5%* reported cleanliness issues.
- *36.4%* of respondents did not report their last issue; among non-reporters, *40.9%* felt nothing would happen and *36.4%* did not know whom to tell.
- *59.1%* said they often saw the same problem reported by multiple students without being fixed.
- *63.6%* considered status tracking, reminders to the responsible office, and confirmation of resolution useful features.


> **Note:** The survey had 22 responses and was used as preliminary problem validation rather than as a statistically representative study.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Hand Over** is a centralized AI-powered hostel and mess complaint management system.

Students can submit complaints, while the system automatically understands and structures the complaint, detects related/duplicate issues, calculates priority, routes the issue to the appropriate department, monitors unresolved complaints, and supports resolution confirmation.

The system combines **AI for complaint understanding** with **deterministic backend logic for important system decisions**, making the workflow more reliable and controllable.

## 🤖 AI & Technical Architecture

### AI Intake Agent

The intake agent converts an unstructured student complaint into structured information:

- Category
- Severity
- Short title
- Cleaned complaint description
- Sensitive complaint flag
- Follow-up question when an important detail is missing

### Duplicate Detection Agent

The duplicate detection agent compares a new complaint with existing active issues and checks whether they describe the **same underlying real-world problem**.

The system does **not** treat complaints as duplicates simply because they belong to the same category.

### Deterministic Backend Logic

AI is used for understanding the complaint, while important system decisions are handled by the backend.

The backend controls:

- Final routing
- Priority calculation
- Reporter counting
- Complaint grouping
- Timers
- Escalation
- Status changes
- Resolution confirmation
- Audit/event logging

This separation reduces dependence on AI for critical workflow decisions.

## 🧪 AI Evaluation & Reliability

The AI pipeline was evaluated using a **30-case sample dataset** containing hostel and mess complaints across different categories, severities, duplicate situations, and sensitive cases.

### Evaluation Results

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Correct office routing | **25/27 — 92.6%** | ≥90% | ✅ PASS |
| Correct duplicate grouping | **7/8 — 87.5%** | ≥85% | ✅ PASS |
| Wrongly merged complaints | **0/19** | Minimize | ✅ |
| Sensitive complaint detection | **30/30 — 100%** | — | ✅ |
| Severity within ±1 | **26/27 — 96.3%** | — | ✅ |

The evaluation was used to identify errors and validate the AI pipeline before final integration.

The complete sample dataset is included in the repository:

`hostel_mess_30_sample_test_set.json`

## 💎 Originality & Differentiation

Hand Over goes beyond a basic complaint form or ticketing system.

### What makes it different?

- **AI understands unstructured complaints** instead of relying only on fixed form fields.
- **Duplicate complaints are grouped** into a shared issue instead of creating multiple separate tickets.
- **Complaints are automatically routed** to the appropriate department.
- **Priority considers severity, number of reporters, and issue age.**
- **Unresolved complaints trigger automatic reminders and escalation.**
- **Sensitive complaints receive separate/private handling.**
- **Students can confirm resolution or reopen an issue** if the problem was not actually fixed.
- The system provides a **transparent status history** for non-sensitive complaints.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Usability

### Students

Students can:

- Report issues quickly
- Attach supporting photos
- Report anonymously when appropriate
- Track issue status
- Confirm or reject a resolution

### Hostel/Mess Staff

Staff receive complaints that are:

- Structured
- Categorized
- Prioritized
- Routed to the appropriate office

### Wardens & Administrators

Management can:

- Monitor active issues
- See unresolved complaints
- Receive escalations
- Track recurring problems
- Review issue history

### Deployment Potential

## 🔐 Responsible Design & Trust

Hand Over is designed to keep sensitive complaints and important administrative decisions under controlled handling.

### Privacy & Security

- Authentication through Supabase Auth
- Role-based access for different users
- Anonymous complaint support
- Sensitive complaints are not exposed on the public tracker
- Complaint and issue events can be recorded for accountability
- Photos are stored using Supabase Storage

### AI Safety

AI is primarily used for **understanding and structuring complaints**.

Critical workflow decisions such as routing, priority, escalation, status changes, and resolution handling remain controlled by backend logic rather than being left entirely to the LLM.

---

## 📈 Scalability

Hand Over is designed with a modular architecture so that the system can grow with the number of students, complaints, departments, and institutions.

### Technical Scalability

- FastAPI provides an API-based backend
- Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL, authentication, and storage
- The AI layer can be scaled independently
- Background monitoring is handled through APScheduler
- The PWA-ready frontend can support additional client platforms
- The API architecture can support future mobile or chatbot interfaces
